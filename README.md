# COVID-19-data-analysis-and-visualization-using-SQL-Tableau
## Project Description:
In this engaging and informative data exploration project, I utilized COVID-19 data sourced from the reputable "Our World in Data" website. Leveraging the capabilities of PostgreSQL and Tableau, I executed a series of insightful SQL queries to extract invaluable insights and create essential key indicators. Then I used Tableau to visually present my findings for better understandinng and decision making.

### I took the following steps in the process:

* Leveraged PostgreSQL and SQL to analyze COVID-19 data from "Our World in Data."
* Created key indicators through data transformation and optimized SQL queries for efficiency.
* Utilized temporary tables and documentation for streamlined data manipulation.
* Gained actionable insights, empowering data-driven decisions during the pandemic
* Interactive interface with filters and real-time updates.
* A valuable resource for informed decision-making and public awareness.
* Simplified complex pandemic data for easy understanding.
